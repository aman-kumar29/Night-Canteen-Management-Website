# NightCanteen
A full stack Web Development Project using MERN Stack. It was designed as part of a Hackathon keeping in mind improving my own college's night canteen. It has many functionalities including Adding food items to a cart, and placing orders. 
There is an Admin Panel only visible to the admin from where they can add, delete, and even modify items.
